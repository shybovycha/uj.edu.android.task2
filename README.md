### IBAN - Android (mandatory)

Create an application with one text edit field (Accound no.) and one button (Send). Pressing the button causes verification of IBAN number in the text field (see Assignment 1.1). The application displays information if the number is valid.

### Sending IBAN number (optional)

Modify application 2.1 so that pressing Send button and positive verification of IBAN number the application jumps to SMS sending application - sms shall already contain the IBAN number. When the text field contains invalid IBAN number or is empty the Send button is disabled or shows appropriate information when pressed.
